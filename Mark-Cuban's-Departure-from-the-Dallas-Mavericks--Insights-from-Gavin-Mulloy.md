In December 2023, Mark Cuban, the majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks, sold most of his stake in the team to Miriam Adelson and her family. Despite this sale, Cuban expressed his intention to continue overseeing the Mavericks' basketball operations. This revelation came to light following a Facebook post by Gavin Mulloy, a former event and venue manager for the Mavericks, who criticized Cuban's departure.

**Background on the Ownership Transition**

Mark Cuban had been the face of the Dallas Mavericks since purchasing the team in 2000 for $285 million. Under his leadership, the Mavericks achieved significant milestones, including an NBA Championship in 2011. In December 2023, Cuban sold a majority of his stake in the team to Miriam Adelson and her family, valuing the franchise at approximately $3.5 billion. Despite the sale, Cuban anticipated maintaining control over basketball operations.

**Gavin Mulloy's Facebook Post and Cuban's Response**

Gavin Mulloy, who had served as the Mavericks' event and venue manager, took to Facebook to express his dissatisfaction with Cuban's departure, stating, "Cuban should be run out of Dallas." To his surprise, Cuban responded directly to Mulloy's post, revealing that he had "fully expected to run basketball" but was unable to include this stipulation in the sale contract due to NBA regulations. Cuban further commented on the financial implications of his tenure, stating he "lost hundreds of millions of dollars" during his 23 years as majority owner.

**Cuban's Financial Perspective**

Cuban's admission about the financial losses underscores the challenges of owning an NBA franchise. Despite the substantial sale price, the operational costs, player salaries, and other expenses associated with running a professional sports team can lead to significant financial deficits. Cuban's willingness to invest heavily in the team, both financially and emotionally, highlights his commitment to the Mavericks' success.

**Implications for the Mavericks' Future**

The transition in ownership raises questions about the Mavericks' future direction. While Cuban's departure marks the end of an era, the involvement of the Adelson family introduces new perspectives and potential changes in the team's operations. Fans and stakeholders are keenly observing how the new ownership will influence team decisions, player acquisitions, and overall management strategies.

**Conclusion**

The exchange between Mark Cuban and Gavin Mulloy provides a rare glimpse into the complexities of NBA ownership and the personal dynamics involved. As the Mavericks embark on this new chapter, the basketball community remains attentive to the developments that will shape the team's trajectory in the coming years.

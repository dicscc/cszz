The fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) with creative arts has led to groundbreaking innovations, one of the most notable being the ability to generate images in the distinctive style of Studio Ghibli using ChatGPT. This development has sparked both excitement and controversy, raising questions about creativity, copyright, and the future of artistic expression.

**The Emergence of AI-Generated Ghibli-Style Art**

In early 2025, OpenAI's GPT-4o model introduced a feature that allows users to transform personal photos into illustrations reminiscent of Studio Ghibli's iconic animation style. This capability, often referred to as "Ghiblification," quickly gained popularity, with users sharing their AI-generated artworks across social media platforms.

Galvarino, a renowned Mapuche warrior from the 16th century, stands as a symbol of resistance and resilience against Spanish colonial forces. His story, marked by unparalleled bravery and determination, continues to inspire and captivate historians and enthusiasts alike.

**Early Life and the Arauco War**

The exact details of Galvarino's early life remain largely undocumented, leaving much to speculation. However, it is widely accepted that he was a member of the Mapuche people, an indigenous group inhabiting the region that is now Chile and Argentina. During the mid-1500s, the Mapuche engaged in the Arauco War, a prolonged conflict aimed at resisting Spanish colonization efforts. Galvarino emerged as a prominent figure in this struggle, demonstrating exceptional leadership and combat skills.

**The Battle of Lagunillas and Capture**

In 1557, Galvarino participated in the Battle of Lagunillas against the Spanish forces led by Governor García Hurtado de Mendoza. The Mapuche warriors, despite their valiant efforts, were defeated. Galvarino, along with approximately 150 other Mapuche fighters, was captured by the Spanish. As a punitive measure and to serve as a deterrent to other indigenous resistors, the Spanish authorities ordered the amputation of the right hands and noses of the prisoners. Galvarino, however, had both hands severed. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvarino?utm_source=openai))

**Symbol of Defiance and Return to Battle**

Despite the brutal mutilation, Galvarino's spirit remained unbroken. Upon his release, he returned to the Mapuche leaders, including the Toqui (war leader) Caupolicán, and displayed his injuries as a testament to the Spanish cruelty. Galvarino's resilience and unwavering commitment to his people's cause inspired the Mapuche council to appoint him to lead a squadron in the ongoing resistance. Demonstrating remarkable ingenuity, Galvarino had knives fastened to the stumps of his amputated arms, enabling him to continue fighting.

**The Battle of Millarapue and Final Stand**

Galvarino's leadership was pivotal in subsequent engagements against the Spanish. In the Battle of Millarapue, his squadron faced off against Governor Mendoza's forces. Despite their courageous efforts, the Mapuche were defeated, resulting in the loss of approximately 3,000 warriors and the capture of over 800, including Galvarino. Governor Mendoza ordered his execution, and historical accounts vary regarding the method of his death. Some sources suggest he was executed by hanging, while others claim he was thrown to the dogs.

In recent months, Bishop Marvin Sapp, a renowned gospel artist and pastor, has found himself at the center of a heated debate following a donation request that garnered widespread attention. This article delves into the events surrounding the $40,000 donation appeal, the ensuing backlash, and the broader implications for church fundraising practices.

**The Donation Appeal Incident**

In July 2024, during the 109th Pentecostal Assemblies of the World Convention in Baltimore, Bishop Sapp addressed a congregation of approximately 1,000 attendees, with an additional 1,000 participating online. During his sermon, he urged the congregation to "plant a seed" of $20 each, aiming to raise a total of $40,000. To facilitate this, Sapp instructed the ushers to "close the doors," a directive intended to create a focused environment for the offering.

**The Backlash**

The video of this incident quickly went viral, sparking significant criticism across social media platforms. Critics accused Sapp of coercive fundraising tactics, with some questioning the ethics of his approach.

**Bishop Sapp's Response**

In response to the backlash, Bishop Sapp appeared on The Rickey Smiley Morning Show on March 31, 2025, to clarify the circumstances surrounding the donation request. He explained that the funds were intended for the conference's budget, not for his personal church. Sapp acknowledged that his delivery might have been more assertive than necessary and apologized for any offense caused. He emphasized that the directive to close the doors was not meant to lock them but to ensure a secure and respectful environment for the offering.

**Escalation of Criticism**

**Clarification from the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World**

The Pentecostal Assemblies of the World, Inc. also addressed the situation, stating that leaders of the denomination had asked Sapp to seek a "free-will offering" to help pay for expenses of its International Summer Convention and other P.A.W. expenses. They clarified that the directive to close the doors was an internal security protocol, which was unfortunately taken out of context.

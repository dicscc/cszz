On March 28, 2025, a catastrophic 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck near Mandalay, Myanmar, profoundly affecting both Myanmar and neighboring Thailand. This article delves into the earthquake's impact on Thailand, examining the immediate effects, the collapse of a Bangkok skyscraper, ongoing recovery efforts, and the broader implications for regional seismic activity.

**Immediate Impact on Thailand**

The earthquake's epicenter was approximately 17.2 kilometers from Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city. Despite the distance, the tremors were strongly felt across central and northern Thailand, including Bangkok, where roads buckled and buildings sustained damage.

**Bangkok Skyscraper Collapse**

In Bangkok, the earthquake led to the collapse of a 30-story skyscraper under construction for government offices. The building, located near the Chatuchak market, was 30% complete at the time of the collapse. The incident resulted in at least 60 confirmed worker deaths, nine injuries, and 34 individuals still unaccounted for as of April 24, 2025.

**Ongoing Recovery Efforts**

In the aftermath, Thai authorities declared a disaster zone in Bangkok and initiated search and rescue operations at the collapsed construction site. Rescue workers employed excavators and cranes to remove debris and search for survivors. The Thai Meteorological Department also monitored aftershocks, with magnitudes ranging from 3.0 to 4.0, and advised the public to remain vigilant.

**Broader Implications for Regional Seismic Activity**

The 2025 Myanmar earthquake has heightened awareness of seismic risks in the region. The Sagaing Fault in Myanmar, a major active fault, has been identified as a potential source of significant earthquakes. While the fault could trigger a 7.5-magnitude earthquake in the next 5-10 years, experts suggest that Thailand may not face serious damage from such an event.

**Conclusion**

The 2025 Myanmar earthquake has had a profound impact on Thailand, particularly in Bangkok, where the collapse of a skyscraper under construction resulted in significant loss of life. Ongoing recovery efforts continue to address the immediate aftermath, while regional seismic activity remains a concern for future preparedness.

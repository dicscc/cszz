**Key Features and Benefits**

1. **Hypoallergenic and Gentle on Sensitive Skin**

2. **Eco-Friendly and Sustainable**

   In an era where environmental sustainability is paramount, PATCH bandages stand out by being biodegradable and compostable.

   Bamboo is naturally antimicrobial, which helps protect minor wounds from infection. This feature, combined with the breathable yet waterproof design, allows for optimal healing conditions by keeping out germs and moisture while letting the skin breathe.
